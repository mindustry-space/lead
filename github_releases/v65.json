Yes, it was bad.\r\n- Added custom wave editor-- needs testing! [Editor]\r\n- Added generate/filter dialog [Editor]\r\n- Added scatter AA turret (again)\r\n- Added scorch anti-ground turret (...again)\r\n- Added mandatory tutorial for placing things in lines because people don't seem to want to read anything unless I force them to [Mobile]\r\n- Added map reload command [Server]\r\n- Added antialiasing setting [Desktop]\r\n- Added back sand, grass blocks\r\n- Added many other new blocks, more to come\r\n- Added animated water setting, disabled by default on mobile\r\n- Added enemy indicators (again)\r\n- Added diagonal conveyor/block placement (hold ctrl on desktop, check game settings for mobile)\r\n- Added capacity bars to blocks that were missing them (bridges, mass drivers...)\r\n- Added new ore system, allowing ores to be placed on any block\r\n- Made zoom level be less restrained\r\n- New map format for much smaller map filesizes, should convert old maps without any issues\r\n- Removed base zone costs, now only starting items are factored in\r\n- Reduced all tech tree costs more than 3x\r\n- Many various tweaks to zone maps and waves\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n- On Android, locking the screen and returning to the game sometimes makes all machine stop.
