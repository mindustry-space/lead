  "body": "While this version is technically network-compatible with 132, it has significant behavioral differences that warrant a new release. I would rather not see massive desyncs on outdated servers.\r\n\r\n- Fixed logic being able to control dead/removed units (e.g. into payload blocks)\r\n- Fixed deconstructors not checking unit payload size/etc (direct deconstruction was added hours before release and not tested properly)\r\n- Fixed deconstructors sometimes refunding slightly less than 100% of resources\r\n- Fixed constructor being able to create banned/invalid blocks\r\n- Fixed player units not disappearing when ctrl-clicked into payloads\r\n- Made payload loader only move out containers when >= 1 item is at full capacity\r\n- Added liquid container to tech tree",
