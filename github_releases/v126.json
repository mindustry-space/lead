This allows for self-replicating processors.\n- Logic: Added sensors for `dead`, `controller`, `size`, `boosting`\n- Logic: Made `controlled` return ctrlProcessor/ctrlPlayer/ctrlFormation/0 depending on controller type\n- Logic: Deprecated \"commanded\"; use `controlled` instead! This sensor will be removed in a future release.\n- Logic: More hints",
